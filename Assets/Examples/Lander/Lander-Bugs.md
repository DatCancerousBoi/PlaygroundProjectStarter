# Bugs-to-fix

1. Game overs

*Immediatley die when you hit a rock

*Just play the game to recreate

*Solution: reduce the damage the rocks do to the main player

2. Hitting rocks

*No bounce-back or temporary invulrability when you hit a rock

*Just have the two objects colide to experiance.

*Add a temporary invulrability and bounce-back between the two objects of the player and the rock.

3. Wonky Controls
 
*The main player slides around due to the loose controls and how they handle.

*Set the rotation speed to 0.5 and the push to 10.

*I will most likley change the above values to help make the controls tighter.
